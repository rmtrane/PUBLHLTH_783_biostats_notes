This is where you’ll find my notes for the biostatistics part of this class for Fall 2019. These notes are meant to be a supplement to lectures and Sullivan (2017). If you have any doubts as to what parts of the book I think are more important, this is a good place to look. There’s a good chance that if it is not included here, I do not care too much about it. That being said, things included here might not be elaborated to a satisfying extent, and therefore I do NOT recommend that you rely solely on these notes, but rather use them in conjunction with the book, and, just as importantly, lectures. I want to emphasize that these notes are not exhaustive, but are meant to complement lectures. We simply won’t have time to cover everything in the amount of detail I would like. Therefore, I will use these notes to write down some thoughts on certain topics that I think you might as well read outside the classroom. At times I will ask you to read sections before showing up to lectures. Other times, I won’t even make the material available to you until after lectures. There’s good reason for that. Some things are easier to explain when you have already seen them before. Other concepts can be scary on paper, and are best introduced by another human being. In either case, it is extremely important that you show up to lectures. Finally, note that this collection is a living thing. It will change throughout the semester as we move along. Sometimes I might go back and clarify sections, if it seems to be necessary. At the beginning of the class you’ll only find the first part, but as we make our way through, I will publish more notes on the topics to be covered later. Bounty Program As already mentioned, this is a living document. Furthermore, it is very much so the first version. Therefore, there will inevitably be mistakes. Hopefully, most of them will be minor, but I would be surprised if there isn’t a few major ones here and there. Therefore, I really hope that you will all help me out and let me know whenever you find mistakes, no matter how small they might seem. Now, I know that noone wants to do that – who has the time to send an email just to let some fool know they can’t spell “stastitics”. But it’s important to me to gradually improve these notes, and often being made aware of small mistakes opens up ones eyes to bigger ones. So to incentivize you to report mistakes, I have decided to start a bounty program: if you as a group gather more than 20 points (see below on how to collect points), there will be a reward at the end of the semester! If you find a mistake, simply shoot me an email, let me know where the mistake is, and what type you think it is. Type of Mistake Points Spelling/grammatical error 1 Math error 2 Conceptual nonsense in either text or math 3 References "],

Biostatistics is “simply” statistics applied to a specific set of problems, namely problems related to biological questions. Hence, the question “what is biostatistics?” is quickly replaced by “what is statistics?” From Wikipedia1: “Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, displaying, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.” That is quite the range, but all it is saying is that statistics is the science of making sense of data. It is very hard to pinpoint exactly what statistics is, but it is rather easy to dismiss at least one very common misunderstanding: statistics is NOT an exact science. There is (almost) never just one answer to a question. Rather, statistics is a decision science in the sense that at every step of the way, from study design to data collection to data presentation to data analysis and interpretation, you have to make decisions. And inevitably, your conclusions depend on every single one of those decisions. 2.2 Biostatistics in PUBLHLTH 783 In this class, we’ll be considering what might seem like a very simple setup with simple questions, and a general approach to answering said questions. The truth is basically all statistical methods, no matter how complicated they might seem, follow (to some extend) this exact pattern. In this class, we will work our way through this pattern, and talk about how the simplest of methods work. The hope is that when we’re done, you take these simple methods with you, and whenever you encounter more complicated methods, you can draw parallels back to what you have seen here, which hopefully will help you make at least some sense of even the most complicated methods. The story begins… Any statistical analysis begins with a research question. This question always relates to a certain feature or characteristic of a certain population, or of multiple populations. The population is the group of entities one wants to learn more about. It could be that one is interested in the life expectancy (feature) of U.S. adults (population), risk of diabetes (feature) among people with a certain genetic profile (population), the resistance to a disease (feature) among ants in Governor Dodge State Park (population), strength (feature) of pipes produced by a certain manufacturer (population), etc. Now, the first fundamental idea of the approach we’ll pursue in this class is this: there is a single true answer to the question asked. The only one way to obtain the truth is to observe the entire population. If we could measure the disease status (diabetes/no diabetes) of every single individual with the genetic profile of interest, we could evaluate the true risk. The catch is, maybe obviously to someone, that this is simply not feasible. Often we do not even know exactly how big the population of interest is, which means it is impossible to survey every single subject in the population. And even if we knew exactly how many people were part of the population, how to get a hold of them, and how to convince them to participate in our study, it is very unlikely we would have the resources (read: $$$) to reach out and include every single one of them. This leads us to the picture we will return to over and over again in this class: there is some population of interest. We want to say something about a certain feature of the population. This will usually be a mean of a measurement, the risk ratio or odds ratio of two groups, or something similar. Unfortunately, there is no way we can actually measure the feature for every single subject in the population – if we could, we would simply calculate the mean, and be done with it! Instead, we take a sample from the population. The hope is that we obtain this sample in such a way that the sample is representative of the entire population, and therefore we can use the information obtained from the sample to say something about the population. When we talk about chances of observing something when sampling from the population, we talk about probabilities. What is the probability a sample of 23 people has more than 5 diabetics? What is the probability a randomly chosen individual from Minneapolis will develop cancer? When we try to use a sample to say something about the general population from which the sample was created, we do inference. The plot thickens… We now have an idea of what it is we want to do: take a sample, obtain some information about the thing of interest, then use that information to say something about the general population. Pretty simple. The problem is, how do we actually put the pieces together in a way that allows us to generalize to the population? Example: we are interested in estimating the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in the general population of U.S. adults. We have a hunch that the true prevalence is 11%. We take a sample of 3799 female U.S. adults of which 379 have a history of CVD. So, the prevalence is estimated to be \\(\\frac{379}{3799} \\approx 10 \\%\\)2. The prevalence in our sample is clearly different from our hypothesis, so clearly our hypothesis is wrong…. right? If only it was that simple. The problem here is that our prevalence estimate depends on the specific sample we got. If we were to repeat this experiment, we would ask a different group of people about their history of CVD, which would lead to a different estimate of the prevalence. There’s simply no way (or it is at least very, very unlikely) we’ll ever get a sample of people for which the prevalence matches our hypothesis exactly. So the question is not simply if our sample has the same prevalence as hypothesized, but rather is it “close enough” for us to believe our hypothesis. Close enough? Did I read that right? Yup. The majority of statistical methods, and definitely everything we’ll be talking about in this class, are trying to decide if what we observe in our sample is “close enough” to our hypothesize about the population. The idea is that if what we observe is very far from our hypothesis, then it is unlikely that the hypothesis is true. There are generally two ways of framing the question: Is what we observe (think prevalence in sample) “close enough” to the hypothesis (that the prevalence in the population is 11%)? What range of hypotheses (values for the prevalence) would we accept given what we observed? The first approach is refered to as testing a statistical hypothesis, or null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), while the second is refered to as constructing a confidence interval. These two are closely related, as we will see later, but the information contained in the results differ drastically. While testing a hypothesis only provides you with a result concerning one value, the confidence interval gives you a wide range of values that you to some extent believe could be the true value. Why would anyone then ever report the result of a statistical hypothesis test without a confidence interval, you ask? That is a very, very, very good question to which I do not have an answer… This has all been very abstract (and I think I got carried away in that last paragraph), so let’s try take a look at some specific examples of statistical analyses.
